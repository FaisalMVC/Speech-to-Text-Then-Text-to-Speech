# Speech-to-Text-Then-Text-to-Speech
In this task I used ibm waston STT and TTS services to convert the user voice to text, then I saved it into txt file.I named it context.txt. I added a function  to convert the text from context.txt file to a speech using TTS service. I saved it into speech.mp3, After that it will play the speech using pygame library to deal with mp3 file.
